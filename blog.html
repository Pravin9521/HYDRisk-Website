                  providing clean energy to the local grid.
                </p>
                <h4>Flood Event</h4>
                <p>
                  Continuous heavy rainfall over a 10-day period resulted in
                  severe flooding across Kerala. The solar PV plant site was
                  inundated by floodwaters, submerging a significant portion of
                  the plant infrastructure, including solar panels, inverters,
                  and electrical components.

                  The case study of the solar PV plant in Kerala, India,
                  highlights the real economic impact of floods on renewable
                  energy infrastructure. The combination of infrastructure
                  damage, repair costs, lost energy production, and missed
                  revenue underscores the need for comprehensive climate
                  resilience strategies in the renewable energy sector. As
                  climate change-induced extreme events become more frequent,
                  such case studies emphasize the importance of incorporating
                  adaptive measures to mitigate potential economic losses.
