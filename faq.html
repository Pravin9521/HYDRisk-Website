                <p>
                  Flood risk assessment is the process of identifying and
                  evaluating the potential for flooding at a specific location
                  and understanding its likely impact. It's crucial for
                  protecting lives, property, and investments, as well as for
                  meeting regulatory requirements for new developments or
                  existing structures in flood-prone areas.

              <div class="faq-answer">
                <p>
                  Anyone planning a new development (residential, commercial,
                  industrial), making significant changes to an existing
                  property, or those concerned about flood exposure, especially
                  in areas identified as flood zones, should consider a flood
                  risk assessment. It's often a mandatory requirement for
                  planning permissions.

                How does climate change affect flood risk?
              </button>
              <div class="faq-answer">
                <p>
                  Climate change is increasing the frequency and intensity of
                  extreme weather events, leading to higher rainfall, rising sea
                  levels, and more unpredictable flooding. This means that
                  historical flood data alone may not be sufficient, and future
                  flood risks need to be carefully assessed and modelled.

                <p>
                  The timeframe for an FRA depends on the complexity and size of
                  the site, the available data, and the specific requirements of
                  the project. We aim to provide timely and efficient services,

              <button class="faq-question">
                Can a solar PV plant really be at high flood risk?

              <div class="faq-answer">
                <p>
                  Absolutely. While solar panels are designed to be outdoors,
                  large-scale solar farms can be significantly impacted by
                  flooding. Submergence can damage panels and electrical
                  components, erode foundations, and disrupt power generation.
                  Our FRAs specifically address these unique vulnerabilities.

            <h3>Questions about Hydraulic Modelling</h3>
            <div class="faq-item">
              <button class="faq-question">
                What is the difference between hydrological and hydraulic

              </button>
              <div class="faq-answer">
                <p>
                  Hydrological modelling focuses on the overall water cycle,
                  predicting rainfall-runoff processes and water flow volumes in
                  a catchment. Hydraulic modelling then takes these outputs to
                  simulate how that water moves through specific channels,
                  floodplains, and infrastructure, predicting water depths,
                  velocities, and flood extents. They often work hand-in-hand
                  for comprehensive analysis.

              <div class="faq-answer">
                <p>
                  We utilize industry-standard, advanced hydraulic modelling
                  software (e.g., HEC-RAS, InfoWorks ICM, MIKE FLOOD) to ensure
                  accuracy and reliability in our simulations. Our team is

              <div class="faq-answer">
                <p>
                  Yes, definitely. By simulating various flood scenarios,
                  hydraulic modelling provides crucial information for
                  developing effective emergency response plans, including
                  identifying evacuation routes, critical infrastructure at
                  risk, and areas that require immediate attention during a

                  surface water runoff close to its source, often through
                  methods like permeable pavements, rain gardens, swales, and
                  detention ponds, reducing flood risk and improving water

                <p>
                  By shaping the land to create appropriate slopes, levelling
                  and grading ensure that surface water runoff is efficiently
                  directed away from critical areas and towards designated
                  drainage systems. This prevents localized flooding and reduces
                  the overall flood vulnerability of the site.

                  current flood risks based on historical data and existing
                  conditions. Climate Risk Flood Analysis, on the other hand,
                  specifically incorporates future climate change projections
                  (e.g., IPCC scenarios) to predict how flood risks might evolve
                  over various time horizons (e.g., 2050, 2080). It's about
                  future-proofing your assets against a changing climate.

                <p>
                  We utilize projections from reputable climate models and
                  authoritative bodies such as the Intergovernmental Panel on
                  Climate Change (IPCC), national meteorological services, and
                  regional climate agencies. This ensures our analysis is based
                  on the most up-to-date scientific understanding of climate
                  change impacts.

              <button class="faq-question">
                Is Climate Risk Flood Analysis mandatory for all projects?
              </button>
              <div class="faq-answer">
                <p>
                  While not always mandatory, it is becoming increasingly
                  critical for long-term investments, large-scale
                  infrastructure, and projects in vulnerable areas. Many
                  investors, insurers, and even some regulatory bodies are now
                  requesting or requiring climate risk assessments as part of
                  due diligence. It's a proactive measure for true long-term
                  resilience.
