          <h3>General Questions</h3>
          <div class="faq-item">
            <button class="faq-question">
              What is flood risk assessment and why is it important?
            </button>
            <div class="faq-answer">
              Flood risk assessment is the process of identifying and evaluating
              the potential for flooding at a specific location and
              understanding its likely impact. It's crucial for protecting
              lives, property, and investments, as well as for meeting
              regulatory requirements for new developments or existing
              structures in flood-prone areas.

            <button class="faq-question">
              Who needs a flood risk assessment?
            </button>
            <div class="faq-answer">
              Anyone planning a new development (residential, commercial,
              industrial), making significant changes to an existing property,
              or those concerned about flood exposure, especially in areas
              identified as flood zones, should consider a flood risk
              assessment. It's often a mandatory requirement for planning
              permissions.

          <div class="faq-item">
            <button class="faq-question">
              How does climate change affect flood risk?
            </button>
            <div class="faq-answer">
              Climate change is increasing the frequency and intensity of
              extreme weather events, leading to higher rainfall, rising sea
              levels, and more unpredictable flooding. This means that
              historical flood data alone may not be sufficient, and future
              flood risks need to be carefully assessed and modelled.

          <h3>Questions about Hydraulic Modelling</h3>
          <div class="faq-item">
            <button class="faq-question">
              What is the difference between hydrological and hydraulic
              modelling?
            </button>
            <div class="faq-answer">
              Hydrological modelling focuses on the overall water cycle,
              predicting rainfall-runoff processes and water flow volumes in a
              catchment. Hydraulic modelling then takes these outputs to
              simulate how that water moves through specific channels,
              floodplains, and infrastructure, predicting water depths,
              velocities, and flood extents. They often work hand-in-hand for
              comprehensive analysis.
